        { question: "PCP vs. leasing - which is better?", answer: "Car leasing works by essentially renting a brand-new vehicle for an agreed period, typically between 2-4 years. You pay an initial rental fee and make fixed monthly payments until your lease ends. When your contract finishes, simply return the car. Read more in our complete guide to <a href=\"/advice/personal-leasing/what-is-car-leasing\">what is car leasing?</a>" },
        { question: "How does leasing a car work?", answer: "Car leasing means you can drive the latest models every few years and return the vehicle when your contract ends. PCP works similarly, except you can buy the car at the end of your agreement. You’ll pay interest on a PCP, plus a balloon payment if you purchase the vehicle." },
        { question: "Is it better to buy or lease a car?", answer: "Leasing gives you the benefit of driving a new car without paying an expensive upfront cost. Instead, you’ll make affordable fixed payments while taking advantage of the manufacturer’s warranty, lower maintenance costs and road tax included. But you won’t own the car at the end of the lease. See more about <a href=\"/advice/personal-leasing/is-it-better-to-lease-or-buy-a-car\">car leasing vs. buying</a>." },
        { question: "How much does it cost to lease a car?", answer: "You’ll make fixed monthly payments based on the value of your chosen car. Other leasing costs include your initial rental (between 1-12x your monthly payment) and a £199 processing fee. Read more about the <a href=\"/advice/costs/how-much-does-it-cost-to-lease-a-car\">cost of car leasing</a>." },
        { question: "What are the pros and cons of leasing a car?", answer: "The benefits of leasing include the advantage of driving the latest car every 2-4 years, low monthly payments, a manufacturer’s warranty, fewer maintenance costs and no negative equity as you return the car when the contract ends. But you’ll need to keep to an agreed mileage limit and won’t own the car." },
        { question: "What do I need to know when leasing a car?", answer: "The most important thing to know about car leasing is that you’ll be renting a brand-new vehicle of your choice, making fixed monthly payments for 2-4 years. Personal and business leases are both available. You must stick to your agreed mileage limit and keep the car in a good condition that meets the <a href=\"/fair-wear-and-tear\">BVRLA Fair Wear and Tear Guidelines</a>." },
        { question: "Do car leases include maintenance and insurance?", answer: "Maintenance and insurance can be included in your lease with our <a href=\"/car-leasing-with-insurance\">car leasing with insurance</a>. This includes breakdown cover, accident management, glass cover, a replacement vehicle, plus routine maintenance and servicing, all part of your monthly payments." },
        { question: "What is Personal Contract Hire (PCH)?", answer: "Personal Contract Hire (PCH) is another term for personal car leasing. This is for individuals who want to lease a car on a personal basis. You will pay an initial rental fee and make fixed monthly payments depending on how long you want your lease to last (usually between 2-4 years). When your lease ends, you return the car." },
